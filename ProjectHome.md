This is [NetBSD](http://netbsd.org) version of mkdep ported to other platforms.

Because it is a C program and does all postprocessing and file handling without calling any external programs, it is up to 10-percent faster than the original BSD mkdep shell script. Also it contains options not available in the original BSD mkdep.
